Hi, I like to program software and create immersive environments bringing ideas into reality.
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from University of California, Merced
in December 2024. I'm currently seeking an opportunity to grow and apply my skill.

Projects I'm working on
- Splatstats: A Discord bot that retrieves stats and interacts with Nintendo's API. 
- ThreejsRoom: An interactive 3D environment built with Three.js for the browser.
